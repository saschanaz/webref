# CSS patches

These are patches applied to the CSS extracts scraped from specs to produce the `@webref/css` package. These patches can break as specs are updated and thus need ongoing maintenance.

For details on how to create and update patches, please see the [Web IDL patches documentation](../idlpatches/README.md)
